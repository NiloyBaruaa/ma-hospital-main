            <p className='text-md'>At BRAC Healthcare, we understand that healthcare is about more than just treating illness and injuries. It is about treating and caring for people.

                    <p className='text-md'>In the heart of BRAC Healthcare lies the essence of love and respect, just like the forget-me-not flower. Our logo, a five-petaled forget-me-not, represents our promise to always prioritize our patients, putting them at the centre of all that we do. With the forget-me-not as our inspiration, we strive to deliver the best possible healthcare service, one that never forgets the importance of true care and compassion. Our patients are not just mere numbers to us, but cherished individuals that we vow to keep close, like the petals of a forget-me-not.</p>
